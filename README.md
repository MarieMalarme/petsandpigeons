We created this website in March 2018 at the Wild Code School in order to train ourselves to code in HTML & CSS, while using the Bootstrap framework. We also used a little bit of JavaScript & jQuery.

The website is supposed to be the portfolio of Wildo Codak, a photographer who's in love with Paris. It displays through 4 pages the latest projects of the artist (the homepage), his complete portfolio (the portfolio page), some information about him (the about page) and allows users to reach him thanks to a form (the contact page).

We presented each step of this project in front of a fictive client every Friday during 3 weeks ; the final demonstration took place on the 16th of March 2018.
